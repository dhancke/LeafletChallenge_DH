Instructions

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

This activity involves visualising USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organisations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

The instructions for this activity are broken into two parts:

Part 1: Creating the Earthquake Visualisation

Part 2: Gathering and plotting more data (Optional with no extra points earning)

Instructions are in line of the code.
